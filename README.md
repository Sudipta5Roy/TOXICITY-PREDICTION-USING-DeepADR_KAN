DATASET :- DEEPTOX(TOX21) 

Developed a robust toxicity prediction framework using a DeepADR-inspired Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) fusion architecture over dual-modality ECFP-derived features (dense descriptors + sparse fingerprints). Built a 5-fold stratified cross-validation pipeline with modality-wise preprocessing, class-weighted optimization, adaptive LR scheduling (ReduceLROnPlateau), gradient clipping, and early stopping, resulting in improved ROC-AUC, F1-Score, and balanced accuracy.
